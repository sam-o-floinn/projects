The GameMix project was created in the Java Spring Boot framework, as a means of testing it.

To run the app, download the .zip file, extract it and open the it in the workspace of any Java IDE.
I would recommend IntelliJ, as that is what I programmed the project in.

This project uses Java Spring Boot to create a web-playable game of Blackjack, where the user competes against an AI to
get the best score. It also makes use of Thymeleaf for view presentation and handling view-side logical operations.

It makes use of autowiring, the MVC model, and polymorphism to communicate between objects based on the user's current actions.
e.g when the user draws their next card, the controllers share that information across their models, and relay the necessary
information to the views. The player can play a number of games against the computer, and numerous actions 
(e.g draw a card, hold, set the value of their Ace, or see a card in the computer's hand).
The game also keeps track of how many games in a single session that you've played and how many you've won.

I made this after completing a course on Java Spring by Tim Buchanan, as proof that I understood the nuances of Spring well enough
to create my own work. I feel very confident now in the Spring environment, that my understanding of it has broadened and I could
code projects like this or harder in my own time at a faster rate.
